[Verse 1]
You say it's all in my head
And the things I think just don't make sense
So where you been, then? Don't go all coy
Don't turn it 'round on me like it's my fault
See, I can see that look in your eyes
The one that shoots me each and every time (each and every time)
[Chorus]
You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me and wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me and wish I was her
[Verse 2]
These days when I see you
You make it look like I'm see-through
Do tell me why you waste our time
When your heart ain't in it and you're not satisfied
You know I know just how you feel
I'm starting to find myself feeling that way too when
[Chorus]
You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me and wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me and wish I was her

[Bridge]
Time and time again, I play the role of fool
(Just for you)
And even in the daylight when you think that
(I don't see you)
I try to look for things I hear but our eyes never find
Though I do know how you play
[Chorus]
You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me and wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me and wish I was her
You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me and wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me and wish I was her
