Lovesong Lyrics
On “Lovesong”, Adele takes The Cure’s classic rock ballad for a sensual, bossa-nova spin. On the standard edition of 21, it’s the penultimate track; on others (like the iTunes version), it’s just the tenth.
[Verse 1]
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am home again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am whole again
[Verse 2]
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am young again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am fun again
[Chorus]
However far away, I will always love you
However long I stay, I will always love you
Whatever words I say, I will always love you
I will always love you
[Verse 3]
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am free again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am clean again
[Chorus]
However far away, I will always love you
However long I stay, I will always love you
Whatever words I say, I will always love you
I will always love you
However far away, I will always love you
However long I stay, I will always love you
Whatever words I say, I will always love you
I'll always love you

[Outro]
I'll always love you
'Cause I love you
Love, love
